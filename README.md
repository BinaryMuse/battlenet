    A Ruby library for the Battle.net Community Platform API

Battlenet is a Ruby library that exposes Blizzard's [Community Platform API](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2369881371).

Installing
==========

Battlenet is available as a Ruby gem. Install it via

    [sudo] gem install battlenet

Use
===

Simply create an instance of `Battlenet`, passing in an optional region as a symbol (defaulting to US), and then optionally a public and private key (for app authorization).

Default options:

    api = Battlenet.new

Specifying a region:

    api = Battlenet.new :eu

Specifying a public and private key:

    api = Battlenet.new :us, 'public', 'private'

Battlenet is backed by the excellent [HTTParty gem](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty), which means you can make get requests very simply.

    api.get '/item/12784'

Battlenet also provides modules for each section of the API, providing easy access to the resources.

    api.item '12784'
    api.character 'Nazjatar', 'Cyaga', :fields => "stats,talents,quests"

Configuring
===========

Failing Silently
----------------

By default, if Battlenet receives a non-200 response from the Battle.net API, it will throw an exception. You can turn this behavior off via the `fail_silently` attribute:

    Battlenet.fail_silently = true

Localization
------------

The Battle.net API supports localization via a query string parameter. Battlenet can transparently handle setting this parameter for you on every request. Just set the `locale` attribute:

    Battlenet.locale = "en_GB"

Please note that each region only supports certain locales.

Battle.net API Documentation
============================

The documentation for the Battle.net API can be found at http://blizzard.github.com/api-wow-docs/.

What's Missing
==============

The following features are planned but not yet supported:

  * Caching support via Memcached, Redis, etc.
  * If-Last-Modified header support

Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute to the project, please feel free to do so. Just fork the project, commit your changes (preferably to a new branch), and then send me a pull request via GitHub. Be sure to add tests for your feature or fix.

Please do not change the contents of the `VERSION` file, or if you do, do so in a separate commit so that I can cherry-pick around it.

Setting Up the Development Environment
--------------------------------------

The development environment is managed with Bundler.

To install just the gems you need to hack on Battlenet and run the specs, run

    bundle install --without documentation

To install all development gems, including the ones used to generate documentation, run

    bundle install

To run the specs, run

    rake

Writing an Integration Test
---------------------------

High-level integration testing against the Community Platform API is handled via VCR. After the first time running a spec that hits the API, VCR saves the HTTP response in a fixture file and uses this file to run against in the future.

Here's an example (the character integration specs):

    it "fetches character data" do
      VCR.use_cassette('character_mortawa') do
        character = api.character 'nazjatar', 'mortawa'
        character['level'].should == 85
      end
    end

    it "fetches additional character data" do
      VCR.use_cassette('character_mortawa_titles') do
        character = api.character 'nazjatar', 'mortawa', :fields => 'titles'
        character['titles'].find { |t| t['selected'] == true }['name'].should == "Twilight Vanquisher %s"
      end
    end

    it "fetches characters with non-ASCII characters in their name" do
      VCR.use_cassette('character_nonstandard_name') do
        character = api.character 'nazjatar', 'Hik√¥'
        character['level'].should == 85
      end
    end

You should always wrap tests that hit the actual API in the `VCR.use_cassette` block, and the resulting fixture file should be checked in with your test.

Building the Documentation
--------------------------

If you have the necessary gems installed (defined in the `documentation` group in the Gemfile), you can easily generate the documentation via

    yard

The generated documentation can be found in `doc/`; open `doc/index.html` to view it.
